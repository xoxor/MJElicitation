output of the second round
* define formally the winner function. This is a function of:
. voters preferences:  describe formally the elicitation process, voters know but we don't and we need to discover
. the five random canditates

First two questions:
* Is this function really a function of the candidates?
** prove with a counterexample

Another question: the random process is fair in terms of probability of being asked about a voter v, but not in terms of v being elected
* define a real winner
** probability of non real winner being elected: is there a profile st this probability is very high? L and H bounds.
*** probability distribution defined on the questions space

What if the set of candidates is variable among the voters:
* they can decide who to rank and how many to rank
