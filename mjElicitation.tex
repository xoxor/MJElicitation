\begin{abstract}
\acl{MJ} (\acs{MJ}) is a voting system where voters assign grades to candidates using an ordinal scale. The winner is the candidate with the highest majority-grade \textemdash which is the median of the grades received. This method has attracted increasing attention of french associations and political parties which have started to use \acs{MJ} for internal decisions or local elections. In particular LaPrimaire.org is a french association that uses \acs{MJ} to choose its candidate for the french presidential election. The vote is conducted in two rounds: in the first one the voters judge five candidates randomly picked; the five candidates with the highest medians pass at the second round as finalists and the voters are asked to judge them. Is the random selection of candidates a good elicitation technique? In this paper we explore the consequences of profile incompleteness and we question the elicitation of voters preferences.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\acl{MJ} (\acs{MJ}) is a voting method proposed by \citet{Balinski2007,Balinski2011} to elect one out of $m$ candidates based on the judgments of $n$ voters. The latter express their preferences by assigning to each candidate one of the following adjectives: Excellent, Very good, Good, Average, Mediocre, Inadequate, To be rejected. Those adjectives represent a common language whose semantic is assumed to be a shared knowledge among the voters carrying thus an absolute meaning. For each candidate the median of the grades she received is computed, this is called \textit{majority-grade}. The candidate with the highest majority-grade is elected. Ties are broken by considering the majority-grade of first order: one vote associated with the majority-grade of each tied candidates is removed and their medians are recomputed. The candidate with the highest new median is elected. If there is still a tie the process is repeated until a unique winner is found. 

In the last few years \acs{MJ} has being adopted by a progressively larger number of french political parties including: Le Parti Pirate, Génération(s), LaPrimaire.org, France Insoumise and La République en Marche.

"Mieux Voter" \citep{MV} is a french association that promotes the use of \acs{MJ} as voting method whenever a collective choice has to be selected: public administration, associations, companies. On their website it is possible to find all the citizens lists \textendash party lists that are not affiliated to any national political party \textemdash that used \acs{MJ} to rank their candidates during the local elections of 2020. In two cases, Bordeaux et Annecy, the candidate selected using \acs{MJ} was then elected as a mayor. 

In particular, LaPrimaire.org \citep{LaPrimaire} is a french political initiative whose goal is to select an independent candidate for the french presidential election using \acs{MJ} as voting rule. The association Democratech implemented the platform for the first time in 2016 in view of the 2017 presidential elections. The number of voters who participated in the election was $10676$ during the first round (with $53383$ votes) and $32685$ during the second round (with $163425$ votes). Between May and October 2021 the process will be repeated to select the candidate who will run for the 2022 presidential elections \citep{LaPrimaire2022}.

The procedure that they adopted consists of two rounds. In the first round each voter is asked to express her judgment, using \acs{MJ}, on five random candidates. At the end of this phase the five candidates with the highest medians are considered the finalists who qualify for the second round. In the second round each voter is asked to express her judgment, using \acs{MJ}, on all the five finalists. The candidate with the best median at the end of this phase is selected as representative for the presidential election.

In this paper we analyse this elicitation process of voters preferences. In particular, we investigate the consequences of randomness when asking the voters to judge candidates. We then search for more efficient techniques both in terms of communication cost \textemdash which can be quantified as number of questions per voter \textemdash and of fairness for candidates \textemdash which reflects the idea that a potential winner should not loose for lack of information.


\subsection{Related work}

The idea of using the median in voting is not new, the first use can be traced back to Galton's 'middlemost' \citep{Galton1907a,Galton1907b}. More recently \citet{Bassett1999} proposed the median as a substitute for Borda's mean, advocating for its statistical robustness \textemdash which measures the sensitivity to departures from the hypothesized model. An equivalent method was proposed by James W. Bucklin in the early twentieth century \citep{Hoag1926} and it was rediscovered several times in literature for example under the names of \textit{Majoritarian Compromise} \citep{Sertel1986,Sertel1999} and \textit{Fallback Bargaining} \citep{Brams2001}. Note, also, that when the number of grades is equal to two (approve, disapprove) then \acs{MJ} is reduced to Approval Voting. 

Several authors studied the strengths and the weakness of this method \citep{Felsenthal2008,Laslier2018} and Balinski replied to most of the critics in an article written in french published on the Revue économique \citep{Balinski2019}.

To the best of our knowledge there are no works on elicitation of voter preferences under \acs{MJ}.

\section{Notation}
Consider a finite set $N$ of voters (or judges) with $\#N=n\geq 2$ and a finite set $A$ of alternatives (or competitors) with $\#A=m\geq 3$. 
A \textit{common language} $\Delta = \{ \alpha, \beta, \dots \}$ is a set of strictly ordered grades. It may, or may not, be finite and the notation $\alpha \geq \beta$ indicates that $\alpha$ is a better or equivalent grade than $\beta$. A profile $P = P(A,N) = \Delta^{m \times n}$ is a $m$ by $n$ matrix of grades. The vector $r_i$, $i\in \intvl{1,m}$, represents the vector of grades $(r_1 , \dots, r_n )$, ordered by decreasing grades $r_1\geq r_n$, associated to the alternative $i$. The double brackets denote an interval in the integers. \commentBN{You're right but to be honest I don't know why I need an ordered vector anymore.}

A grading function $f: P \rightarrow \Delta^m$ is a function that assigns to a profile $P$ a vector of final grades, one for each alternative. A social grading function (SGF) is a grading function $f$ that is neutral, anonymous, unanimous, monotonic, independent of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) and continuous. 
% the \emph{middlemost} aggregation function $f$, for each vector of grades $r_i= (r_1 , \dots, r_n )$ associated to the alternative $i \in \intvl{1,m}$, returns: 
%\begin{align}
%	f(r_i) &= r_{(n+1)/2} \text{ when n is odd,} \\
%	r_{n/2} \geq f(r_i) &\geq r_{(n+2)/2} \text{ otherwise.}
%\end{align}
The \emph{majority-grade}, $f_{maj}$, is a SGF that associates to a profile $P$ a vector of median grade values, one for each alternative, $f_{maj}(P)_i = \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1$, $\forall i \in A$. Observe that as $f_{maj}$ is IIA, it must depend only on $P_i$ so we write $f_{maj}(P_i)$ instead of $f_{maj}(P)_i$.
%i.e. it corresponds to the lower middlemost.

The winner function $F:\Delta^{m} \rightarrow i\in A$ is a function that selects the alternative with the highest median grade as a winner: $F = \argmax_{i\in A}f_{maj}(P_i)$. \commentOC{Are you really defining $F$ here? Then $F$ should appear in the left-hand side of this expression. $F(…) = …$. Also, you can’t use $P$ in the definition of $F$ if that is not in the input of $F$, or deducible from the input. Also, this expression defines a set of alternatives, not a single one as the text suggests.} \commentBN{Does $F(f_{maj}(P)) = \argmax_{i\in A}f_{maj}(P_i)$ work? If yes, can I call this $F^P$ or something as short? }
In case two or more alternatives have the same highest median grade $\alpha$, the tie is broken by removing one $\alpha$ grade from each of the tied alternatives, recomputing the new median grade and repeating the process until one unique winner is found. \commentOC{This would really deserve a formal presentation, as it is possibly unclear what $\alpha$ denotes here and as I suppose the specific definition will be required later.} \commentBN{$\alpha$ is the tied median grade} We will refer with $F^P$ the result of the function $F(f_{maj}(P))$. \commentOC{That’s the procedure without the tie-breaking application, as you have defined things formally, but the text suggests that $F$ designates the procedure after tie-breaking. Also, even this tie-breaking process does not guarantee unicity: what happens if two alternatives receive exactly the same votes? (There is no neutral function that guarantee unicity.) I’d go for sets of winners.}\commentBN{It's chosen randomly, they insist on the unicity.}

\subsection{Incomplete Profile}
In order to analyse the elicitation procedure used by LaPrimaire.org, we need to adapt the notation just described to incomplete profiles. Let $\bar{P} \subseteq P$ be our knowledge about the profile $P$. %The voters have full knowledge of their own judgments that we need to elicit starting from zero knowledge.
The starting knowledge is represented by a matrix $m\times n$ of \textit{Undefined} grades. This is an additional grade that will not count in the computation of the median grade. We define with $K_j \in A$ a set of $k$ random alternatives that we ask the voter $j\in N$ to judge. The resulting incomplete profile obtained from repeating this process for every $j \in N$, is a matrix $k \times n$ of grades, $\Delta^{k\times n}$, and its said to be $k$-sized. Note that when $k=n$ we obtain the complete profile.

The \emph{majority-grade} for incomplete profile $f_{\bar{maj}}: \bar{P} \rightarrow \Delta^m$ is a function that assigns to an incomplete profile $\bar{P}$ a vector of final grades, one for each alternative. 
The \emph{first-step selection function} $F':\Delta^{m} \rightarrow S \subseteq A$ is a function that selects the $s \in \intvl{1,m}$ alternatives with the highest median grades as candidates for the second phase. \commentOC{Then $F'$ should be $F{'s}$, or something similar, as its definition depends on $s$, I suppose. Or do you assume that $s$ is defined and fixed once and for all? In that case you need to specify it to not let the reader wonder. More importantly, there is a problem similar to the one with $F$: it can’t compute median grades as it does not know the profile. I suppose that you mean that $F'$ selects the $s$ best grades among the given instance of $\Delta^m$. But you also need to specify how we make it exactly $s$ in case of ties.}
All the voters are then asked to judge the alternatives in $S$ and we denote this restriction of the complete profile as $P_{S}$. \commentOC{This mixes up the explanations about the process and the mathematical definitions, which risks introducing sloppy reasoning. I suggest to first define $P_S$ as the restriction as you write. Then write that you assume that in the process, when voters are asked about their opinion about $S$, they report the preference corresponding to what they would have stated about the same alternative when asked about $P$ (that is, $P_S(i) = P_i$ when $i \in S$). This is not a gratuitous hypothesis (even if commonly done in social choice.}
Note that we fall back to the complete profile case, thus, we apply the \emph{majority-grade}, $f_{maj}$, function to $P_{S}$ to determine the median grades and then the winner function $F$ to select the winner. \commentOC{We can’t apply $f_{maj}$ to $P_S$ as $f_{maj}$ is defined only for complete profiles. Relatedly, the function $\bar{f_{maj}}$ is not defined yet, is this expected? The reader expects to find a definition here, by similarity to the complete case.}\commentBN{$P_S$ is a complete profile for a subset $S\subseteq A$ of the alternatives.}

\begin{definition}
	We define the real winner $w^*$ of a profile $P$ as the result of $F^P$ when $P$ is complete, i.e. $w^* = \argmax_{i\in A}f_{maj}(P_i)$.
\end{definition}
\commentOC{I don’t understand this definition. I suppose it is related to my previous interrogations.}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:notsamewinner}
	Given $m$ alternatives, $n$ voters and an integer $k \in \intvl{1,m}$, there exists a profile $P$ and two $k$-sized incomplete profiles of $P$, $\bar{P}$ and $\bar{P}'$, such that $F^{\bar{P}} \neq F^{\bar{P}'}$.
\end{proposition}
\commentOC{This looks as if you meant: for all $m, n, k$. I suppose it fails, at least, for $k = m$, right? I suppose you mean that this holds for a specific case, thus, you should state it as such (fixing $m, n, k$), as this is the case that your proof covers. You could write before that this proposition shows that, as expected, the results do not always coincide. OTOH, if I understand the claim correctly, it is sufficiently obvious to not require a proof, for fixed values of $m, n, k$. (A more general result showing that discrepancies happen whatever $k ≠ m$ would be of interest, however, assuming this is true.)}\commentBN{This latter is not true like the example shows}.

\begin{proof} Consider $n=3, m=6, k=5$ and the following complete profile $P$:
	\begin{center}
		$
		\begin{array}{cccc}
			  & j_1 & j_2 & j_3 \\
			a &	Excellent	& Excellent & Inadequate\\
			b &	Mediocre	& Mediocre	& Mediocre\\
			c &	Mediocre	& Mediocre & Inadequate\\
			d &	Average	& Average	& Average\\
			e &	Average	& Mediocre	& Inadequate \\
			f &	Average	& Mediocre & Mediocre	  \\
		\end{array} \quad.
		$
	\end{center}
	The vector of medians $f_{maj}(P)$ is:
	\begin{center}
		$
		\begin{array}{cc}
			a &	Excellent \\
			b &	Mediocre \\
			c &	Mediocre \\
			d &	Average	\\
			e &	Mediocre \\
			f & Mediocre \\
		\end{array} \quad.
		$
	\end{center}
	The real winner is $F^P=a$. 
	
	Consider now the following incomplete profiles $\bar{P}$ and $\bar{P}'$ obtained after having asked each voter to judge $k=5$ random chosen alternatives: \commentOC{This mixes again the process and the maths. The proposition does not talk about randomness and it is confusing to refer to this here. The proposition holds whatever the way $P$ bar is chosen (including, deterministically).}\commentBN{I'm not sure I got this. With randomness I mean the one in the definition of $\bar{P}$.}
	\begin{center}
		$\bar{P}: \qquad
		\begin{array}{cccc}

		$\bar{P}': \qquad

			d &	Average	& Average	& Average \\
			e &	{\color{red}Undefined}	& Mediocre	& Inadequate \\
			f &	Average	& Mediocre & Mediocre	  \\
		\end{array} \quad.
		$
	\end{center}
	The vector of medians are:
	\begin{center}
		$f_{maj}(\bar{P})= \quad
		\begin{array}{cc}
			a &	Inadequate \\
			b &	Mediocre \\
			c &	Mediocre \\
			d &	Average	\\
			e &	Mediocre \\
			f & Mediocre \\
		\end{array} \quad,\quad%
		f_{maj}(\bar{P}')= \quad
		\begin{array}{cc}
			a &	Excellent \\
			b &	Mediocre \\
			c &	Mediocre \\
			d &	Average	\\
			e &	Inadequate \\
			f & Mediocre \\
		\end{array} \quad.
		$
	\end{center}

	Consider the sets of $s=5$ alternatives with the highest median grades for the two profiles, $S'=\{b,c,d,e,f\}$ for $\bar{P}$, and $S^{\prime\prime}=\{a,b,c,d,f\}$ for $\bar{P}'$, and the two restrictions $P_{S'}$ and $P_{S^{\prime\prime}}$. In particular, $P_{S'}$ corresponds to the complete profile when eliminating the alternative $a$, and $P_{S^{\prime\prime}}$ to the complete profile without the alternative $e$.
	The vector of medians are:
	\begin{center}
		$f_{maj}(P_S')= \quad
		\begin{array}{cc}
			b &	Mediocre \\
			c &	Mediocre \\
			d &	Average	\\
			e &	Mediocre \\
			f & Mediocre \\
		\end{array} \quad,\quad%
		f_{maj}(P_S^{\prime\prime})= \quad
		\begin{array}{cc}
			a & Excellent \\
			b &	Mediocre \\
			c &	Mediocre \\
			d &	Average	\\
			f & Mediocre \\
		\end{array} \quad.
		$
	\end{center}
	The winner associated to the incomplete profile $\bar{P}$ is then $F^{P_{S'}} = d$ and the one associated to $\bar{P}'$ is $F^{P_{S^{\prime\prime}}} = a$, thus $F^{\bar{P}} \neq F^{\bar{P}'}$.
\end{proof}
\commentOC{Perhaps some part of this could be transformed to an example.}

\begin{corollary}
	Given $m$ alternatives, $n$ voters and an integer $k \in \intvl{1,m}$, there exist a profile $P$ and an incomplete profile of $P$, $\bar{P}$, such that $F^{\bar{P}}$ is not the real winner.
\end{corollary}
\commentOC{“real winner” is inappropriate here. Is there an unreal winner? I realize that you mean “winner considering the complete profile” VS “winner considering some part of it”, but I don’t think that the term “real” is appropriate. I’d simply say “winners” for the winners of the complete election, and perhaps “approximate winners” for the winners given a partial profile, or something similar.}

\subsection{Electing a non-real winner}
\commentOC{Failing to elect a winner, perhaps?}
In this section we want to investigate the probability of electing an alternative different from the real winner when considering an incomplete profile.

Consider $\bar{P_i}$ the partial vector of ordered grades associated to the alternative $i\in A$, let $C(\bar{P_i}) = \{P_i \in \Delta^n | \bar{P_i} \subseteq P_i\}$ denote the set of possible completions of $\bar{P_i}$. \commentOC{I suppose that this is true only if $P$ bar is a subset of $P$, which should be specified (“given P bar subset of $P$, …”).} \commentBN{Isn't it equivalent to the previous definition $\forall i \in A$ ?}
The set $C(\bar{P}) = \prod_{i \in A} C(\bar{P_i})$ represents the set of complete profiles extending $\bar{P}$; note that $P \in C(\bar{P})$. We define the best completion of a partial vector $\bar{P_i}$ the completion $\hat{P_i}\in C(\bar{P_i})$ such that $f_{maj}(\hat{P_i})\geq f_{maj}(P_i'), \ \forall P_i' \in C(\bar{P_i})$. \commentOC{There are multiple such completions, right?}\commentBN{Yep.}

The only way for a real winner $w^*$ not to get elected is to not be part of the set of candidates for the second phase $S$. \commentOC{Again, unpleasant mix. Please consider stating this first mathematically (something like: “observe that if … then …”, as a provable, mathematical statement). Then, if you deem it useful, indicate to the reader that this, informally, corresponds to the observation that the second phase such and such. Or, conversely, write it first informally then mathematically. (“In other words, if…, then …”.) OTOH, the truth of the claim is sufficiently intuitively clear that I suspect it does not require a proof.}
In fact, suppose $w^*\in S$ and its partial median $f_{maj}(\bar{P_{w^*}})$ is lower than the one of another candidate $i\in A\setminus\{w^*\}$; in the second phase the complete profile restricted to the alternatives in $S$ is built and because $w^*$ is a real winner, then $f_{maj}(P_{S, w^*})\geq f_{maj}(P_{S, i}), \ \forall i \in A$. Thus, a real winner will always win in the second phase. 

Consider the $s$ alternatives with the highest median grades in $\bar{P}$, in particular, let $v$ be the $s$-th highest median, i.e. $v=\max_{i\in S}f_{maj}(\bar{P_i})$. \commentOC{To me the $s$-th highest is lower than the highest, but the expression written here indicates the highest (as in: 1-st highest), unless I am missing something.}\commentBN{"the $s$-th highest is lower than the highest" indeed it's what I mean.}
For $w^*$ not to be in $S$ it must be $f_{maj}(\bar{P_{w^*}})<v$. 
Since $w^*$ is a real winner then $f_{maj}(P_{w^*})>v$, and the grades vector of $w^*$ must be composed of at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor+1$ grades $\alpha>v$ and at most $\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil-1$ of grades $\beta<v$. 
Without loss of generality consider $n$ an odd value, then the vector $P_{w^*}$ in the worst case contains exactly $\frac{n+1}{2}$ grades greater than $v$ and $\frac{n-1}{2}$ grades lower than $v$. Thus, for $f_{maj}(\bar{P_{w^*}})$ to be smaller than $v$, the partial vector $\bar{P_{w^*}}$ of size $x$ must be composed of at least $\frac{x+1}{2}$ grades $\beta<v$ and at most $\frac{x-1}{2}$ grades $\alpha>v$. 
%Try to fix the bynomial parenthesis 
\begin{align}
	P_{w^*}: \qquad [ \underbrace{\alpha_1, \dots , \alpha_{\frac{n+1}{2}}}_{\begin{pmatrix}\frac{n+1}{2} \\ \frac{x-1}{2}\end{pmatrix}}, \underbrace{\beta_1, \dots , \beta_{\frac{n-1}{2}}}_{\begin{pmatrix}\frac{n-1}{2} \\ {\frac{x+1}{2}}\end{pmatrix}} ] \\
	\bar{P_{w^*}}:\qquad [ \overbrace{\alpha_1, \dots , \alpha_{\frac{x-1}{2}}}, \overbrace{\beta_1, \dots , \beta_{\frac{x+1}{2}}}]
\end{align} 
\commentOC{At this stage it seems to me that you are trying to show something, but you did not tell us what. Please state the claim first.} \commentBN{Mmmh, I just wanted to show a visual representation of the concept just described}
\commentOC{Hint: use a latex appropriate command for binomials (I think it’s binom but did not check).} \commentBN{It's what I did at first buy I found it very ugly because I have two fractions inside the binomial.}

\newcommand{\largemath}[1]{{\mathlarger{\mathlarger{\mathlarger{\mathlarger{\mathlarger#1}}}}}}
%note to myself: find a better way please
We define the probability of electing a non-real winner as the probability of $w^*$ not being in $S$. The latter can be defined as the number of incomplete vectors $\bar{P_{w^*}}$ of size $x$ for which $f_{maj}(\bar{P_{w^*}})<v$, over the total number of possible incomplete vectors of $x$ elements:
\[ \frac{ \largemath{\sum}_{i=0}^{x/2}{ \begin{pmatrix}\frac{n+1}{2} \\ {\frac{x-1}{2}-i}\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}\frac{n-1}{2} \\ {\frac{x+1}{2}+i}\end{pmatrix} }}{\begin{pmatrix}n \\ x\end{pmatrix}} \]

The size $x$ of an incomplete vector $\bar{P_i}$ for $i \in A$, depends on the number of questions $k$ asked to the voters, in fact, if we ask $n$ voters to judge $k$ random alternatives, ideally, each alternative $i$ will be judged $\frac{k\cdot n}{m}$ times. Consider the value $k$ as a function of the number of alternatives: $k=c \cdot m$ where $c \in \R$. If $m=10$ and $k=5$ then $k=1/2 m$, i.e. we ask the voters to judge half of the candidates. Thus, the value $x$ depends only on the number of voters $n$ $x=\frac{k\cdot n}{m}= c \cdot n$, $c\in \R$. Without loss of generality we consider both $x$ and $n$ odd values.

Consider the worst case scenario: the real vector $P_{w^*}$ has a proportion of $51\%-49\%$ of $\alpha-\beta$ grades. \Cref{fig:differentX51-49} shows the probability of electing a non-real winner in this scenario for different size $x$ of the incomplete vector $\bar{P_{w^*}}$. \Cref{tab:differentX51-49} shows in details those values. Note that when $x=1001$ the probability is about $25\%$, but we should keep in mind that $x= c \cdot n$, thus a vector of size $1000$ means that the alternative $w^*$ was judged by only $1/10$ of the voters. With this in mind, we see that with $x=\frac{n}{2}$ we obtain a very low probability of only $2.12\%$, but we need $4/5$ of the voters to judge each alternative to get zero probability of "miss-qualification".

The situation change drastically for different proportions of $\alpha-\beta$ grades as \Cref{fig:differentX} shows. In particular, we only need about $200$ judgments (thus $1/50$n) to reach an almost zero probability of electing a non real winner when the real vector $P_{w^*}$ has a proportion of $60\% \alpha -40\% \beta$ grades. Recalling the formula:
\begin{align}
	x&=\frac{k \cdot n}{m} \\
	200&=\frac{k}{m}\cdot 10000 \\
	\frac{1}{50}&=\frac{k}{m} \\
	k&=\frac{m}{50}
\end{align}
we note that asking one question per voter is more than enough to avoid the election of a non-real winner.

In the 2016 elections organised by LaPrimaire.org $n=10675$ voters participated in the first round, and each of them judged $k=5$ random alternatives out of the $m=12$ total ones. Each alternative received an average of $4449$ judgments. Using this data, we simulated th probability of electing a non-real winner for different proportions of $\alpha-\beta$ grades. \Cref{fig:original} and \Cref{tab:original} show the results.

By crossing these results we note that we could have asked the voters far less than $5$ questions, reducing the communication and the cognitive cost of the elicitation process.

\subsection{Unfixed k}

A natural question that comes to mind when considering the process of asking the voters to judge random alternatives is: how feasible is it? Especially when applying it to political elections, it is safe to say that voters have strong opinions. There are always some candidates that we would never want to see in office, while we would really like to support our favorite candidate. By applying the random selection of questions there is a chance we do not get to express our opinions on those particular candidates. In the worst case, we may be asked to judge only candidates of whom we do not have a strong opinion, or worse, that we do not even know. Is our judgment relevant in this case? How willing are we to take the risk to go and vote without the certainty of being able to express the judgments we consider important?

Because of all these reasons, we may want to consider the possibility for the voters to choose the candidates to judge. One extreme situation that may occur is that each voter judges only its best and worst choice. 

\begin{proposition}
	Given two integers $k=5$ and $s=5$, $m$ alternatives and $n$ voters who only judge their best and worst candidates, there exist a complete profile $P'$ and an incomplete profile $\bar{P'}$ such that $P'\in C(\bar{P'})$ and $F(P')\neq F(\bar{P'})$.
\end{proposition}	

\begin{proof} Consider the following complete profile $P$:

	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
			& j$_1$ & j$_2$ & j$_3$ \\
			a	&	Average	&	Average	&	Excellent	\\
			b	&	To be rejected	&	Good	&	Good	\\
			c	&	Mediocre	&	Excellent	&	Mediocre	\\
			d	&	Average	&	Average	&	To be rejected	\\
			e	&	Mediocre	&	To be rejected	&	Mediocre	\\
			f	&	Excellent	&	Inadequate	&	Inadequate \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	
	for the sake of the example the rows are not ordered vectors because the identity of the voters is considered.
	
	The vector of medians $f_{maj}(P)$ is:
	\begin{center}
		$
		\begin{array}{cc}
			a &	Average \\
			b &	Good \\
			c &	Mediocre \\
			d &	Average	\\
			e &	Mediocre \\
			f & Inadequate \\
		\end{array} \quad.
		$
	\end{center}
	The real winner is $F^P=b$. 
	
	Assume that each voter only express its best and worst judgments and construct the complete profile $P'$ from $P$ in the following way: for each alternative $i$ that is not the real winner $w^*$ add as many voters as needed such that its known median grade ($f_{maj}(\bar{P'_i})$) is better than the known median grade of the real winner ($f_{maj}(\bar{P'_{w^*}})$); then add an additional alternative that is rejected by all these new voters. Since the voters only express the best and the worst grades, we are not interested in how they judge the rest of the alternatives, to construct a complete profile we can assume that they judge them according to the current known median. The resulting complete profile $P'$ is the following, but our information $\bar{P'}$ is only restricted to the green values: 

		\scalebox{0.75}{
			\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
				& j$_1$ & j$_2$ & j$_3$ & j$_4$ & j$_5$ & j$_6$ & j$_7$ \\
				a	&	Average	&	Average	&	{\color{teal}Excellent}	&	Average	&	Average	&	Average	&	Average	\\
				b	&	{\color{teal}To be rejected}	&	Good	&	Good	&	Good	&	Good	&	Good	&	Good	\\
				c	&	Mediocre	&	{\color{teal}Excellent}	&	Mediocre	&	Mediocre	&	Mediocre	&	Mediocre	&	Mediocre	\\
				d	&	Average	&	Average	&	{\color{teal}To be rejected}	&	{\color{teal}Excellent}	&	{\color{teal}Excellent}	&	Average	&	Average	\\
				e	&	Mediocre	&	{\color{teal}To be rejected}	&	Mediocre	&	Mediocre	&	Mediocre	&	{\color{teal}Excellent}	&	{\color{teal}Excellent}	\\
				f	&	{\color{teal}Excellent}	&	Inadequate	&	Inadequate	&	Inadequate	&	Inadequate	&	Inadequate	&	Inadequate	\\
				g	&	{\color{teal}To be rejected}	&	{\color{teal}To be rejected} & {\color{teal}To be rejected}& {\color{teal}To be rejected} & {\color{teal}To be rejected} & {\color{teal}To be rejected} & {\color{teal}To be rejected}	\\
			\end{tabular}
		}
		
	The vector of medians $f_{maj}(\bar{P'})$ is:
	\begin{center}
		$
		\begin{array}{cc}
			a &	\text{Excellent} \\
			b &	\text{To be rejected} \\
			c &	\text{Excellent} \\
			d &	\text{Excellent}	\\
			e &	\text{Excellent} \\
			f & \text{Excellent} \\
			g & \text{To be rejected} \\
		\end{array} \quad.
		$
	\end{center}
	The real winner $b$ does not appear in the set of candidates for the second round $S=\{a,c,d,e,f\}$, so it will not be elected from the incomplete profile $\bar{P'}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Does expressing judgment on randomly selected candidates influence the result? (If we change the questions does the result change?)
	\item Does the number of questions influence the result? (If we change the number of questions does the result change?)
	\item If yes, do these effects are mitigated by a second round?
	\item Which is the right number of questions? (Best trade-off between communication cost and optimal result.)
	\item Can we select the next question with minimax regret instead of randomly selecting a candidate?
	\item Can we say anything about the "fairness" of proposing the candidates to judge? Suppose I have strong opinions about only two candidates: one I extremely like and one I extremely dislike. There is a chance I will not be asked about those two candidates, in this case I cannot say much about the other candidates and I am also frustrated because I did not get to express my opinions.
	\item Consider $n$ voters and $m$ candidates and assume that a voter $i \in N$ judges only a fraction of the $m$ candidates. What is the resulting voting rule? What are its properties? Can a voter manipulate the result by judging only some candidates? 
\end{itemize}
